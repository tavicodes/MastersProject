Sadly I am not currently living in my London house, I recently purchased it after selling a house in Spain. You see, I used to have a wife and two children in Spain. They were the love of my life and I cherished all of them dearly. But one day they were driving to the airport to pick me up when a truck lost control and crashed into my wife's car. All three of them passed away instantly. But after a lot of self reflection, I realised that I need to find someone new for the remainder of my time on this world, and help me live it to the fullest.\r\nI love singing and dancing in front of the TV at night, and cooking fresh food with recipes I've gathered from around the world. I like listening to rock and pop, and enjoy reading books of all genres. I want my woman to spend every last second with me, but I understand if she wants her own personal time too. No matter how independent she wants to be, I'd love to be able to treat her on shopping trips and give her anything she wants. I hope this gives you an insight into the type of person that I am, but you are more than welcome to ask me about anything else.\r\nHearts! üíï\r\nFreddie",

I hope it keeps growing because I love every second I spend with you. I am at work now but how was your night? We've been speaking for so long but I haven't told you my childhood. I felt like I should correct that today. Have you ever had a French kiss? Well you'll be happy to know that I was born in France (lol) to a French mother and British father. Shortly after my birth my parents took me to London but a few years later my father sadly passed away. Mum moved back to France as she couldn't cope in London, sending me off to live with my Aunt and Uncle in Egypt. It is there where I went to school and grew up properly. My Uncle was a factory worker who loved his job, but while I was a teenager he died in a work accident. From that day onwards I vowed to improve safety in factories so I studied hard to become a factory manager. Along the way I fell in love with business, eventually studying business management at university.\r\nAfter that I travelled around working for different companies before founding my own, with safety and treatment of workers as the main priority. I fell out of contact with my Aunt but I recently heard that her family had moved to Australia. My previous wife I first met in India and then London before we were married. From marriage till the day she left this world, she was everything in my life and I was everything in hers. Those days are what I'm looking for again, a woman who is everything to me and me to her, a woman who is my world, my solar system, my stars. Our journey has only just begun, but I know from our conversations that this journey will be the greatest in my life. I'd love to hear you, so please call me at +86 174 0363 4700 and I'll be sure to give kisses. üíã\r\nWith much love,\r\nFreddie",

But then they came to the doors and my fears were once again met. According to the inspectors there was a regulation change and the doors that I use are no longer acceptable for factories like this one. Because of this, they were unable to give me the cheque for the final $500k. I feel sick to my stomach with dread. I called the door company asking for a replacement because they sold me unacceptable doors but they're charging me another $12,699 for shipping and replacement fees. I don't know what to do since I hadn't accounted for this. I have nothing left since this was supposed to be the final stage before I got my money.

It all started on Monday. I dressed up smart and with big smile on my face, I entered the bank. I handed the cheque over along with my bank details and the cashier asked me to wait while they checked it out. I waited, and waited some more, until a manager came back and asked me to come with them. Unsure about what was happening I agreed and entered a private room. There they asked me about myself and the money. Since I am not a native here, I assumed they thought I had stolen it. The manager told me that the cheque was made out to a European bank and because it was so large, only the European bank themselves could cash it into my account. Not taking that for an answer I visited all the banks in the area, but they all said the same thing. I did not want to bother you with this, but I still needed money for the plane flight so I asked Brice since he is my closest friend. He gave me the money to pay for the flight, and I got on, thinking many thoughts about my dear wife (you lol). However, the plane was not taking off. Some staff then entered the plane and asked for me personally. I got off the plane with them and they told me that I had not paid tax for using the equipment. I thought the grant from the goverment covered this however it appears not. They told me I can pay the tax and then they'll let me onto the next flight but until then I am stranded here. They said the tax should be around $799 a month for 16 months of work ($12784 total). I also have to pay for luggage storage at the airport and the hotel, as I had checked out of my hotel before getting onto the plane. I think I need to pay $12904 to cover everything. Once again I feel the stress building up in my stomach and I do not know what to do. I miss you dear and I wanted to see you but the universe has given us one more challenge before we can.\r\nNeed you badly,\r\nFreddie",
