- psychological maltreatment (nine categories)
    - economic abuse (central to the experience)
    - creation of fear (when the relationship is ending)
    - isolation:
        - move off the dating platform to private messaging
        - keep the relationship private from family and friends
    - monopolisation (constantly calling and monitoring to keep attention) 
        - can lead to sleep deprivation (mental exhaustion leads to weaker resistance)
    - degradation (verbal abuse)
    - psychological destabilisation (gaslight / crazy-making abuse)
    - emotional / interpersonal withdrawal (increase anxiety)
    - contingent expressions of love (positive reinforcement)

    - took place on WhatsApp
- analysis
    - set up and drip feed 
        - creating "facts" to repeat later on
        - used to contextualize and rationalize monetary requests
        - establish a point of shared interest to build emotional connection
        - tying the facts with emotion to make them seem more real
        - frame inability to provide money as part of the facts
        - then use said inability to ask for money alongside new facts
        - emotive language to generate sympathy
        - use a time limit for receiving the money
        - using marital language can insinuate shared responsibility
    - visceral responses
        - emotional vulnerability
        - cultivates a facade of the victim being in power
        - used to manipulate the victim into action
        - use health related language (feel sick, stressed)
        - frame the assistance as a demonstration of love and dedication to the relationship
        - give the victim a sense of control (do what's best for you)
        - respond to the lack of money, elaborate on the reason why its needed, and then issue a request
            - revisits the topic, inject a sense of urgency and steer the narrative
    - isolating the victim
        - focus on nurturing the relationship
        - reduce contact with friends and family (sources of support)
        - family are trying to break up their relationship
            - she will be lonely forever without him
            - he is her only chance of happiness
        - the scammer is the victim of the victim's reliance on family
        - victim's loneliness is a result of listening to family and friends
        - trust the scammer since he wants to marry her and loves her unconditionally
        - romantic ideal
        - fear of victim talking to friends
            - will speak bad about the scammer
            - makes them want to "go crazy and mad"

        - assign the scammer's actions as responsibility of the victim
        - normalise the monetary requests
        - joint responsibility to keep secret
- conclusion
    - present as rich, powerful and authorative, but also financially needy, romantically and physically vulnerable, and desperate for help
    - social engineering used to reinforce credibility and authenticity, weaken victim's links to sources of support and disguise requests for money
    - focus on protection and preservation of the relationship
    - urgency and secrecy are important but can also reveal the scam
    - reframe requests to mask the scam
    - visceral responses such as declining health and financial penalty alongside referencing previous message topics provide a realistic sense of urgency
    - the pretext of nurturing and protecting the relationship leads to isolation and persuasive arguments
    - use the money to put the victim in a position of power, they can send money to help the suffering scammer
